## About

Since you are here let's start, I am a computer sciene enthusiast that believes that a huge set of problems is lying out there and are waiting to be solved by application of computer science and I aim to be part in a few of them.
I aim to be a **generic** (as seen in JAVA) computer science engineer, that can learn and unlearn things as need be. I like working on anything and everything that can get the work done, no matter wherever I am in that domain.

Here are the fields and languages that I have explored so far :

`JAVA`  `Android`  `Python`  `Machine Learning` `Data Structures` `Algorithms` `Javascript` `Node.js` 

I am open to learn more and better these. You can have a look at the projects that I have done so far. Look at my <a href="#{{ site.pages_list['Projects'] }}" >projects</a> and <a href="#{{ site.pages_list['Timeline'] }}" >timeline</a>  to know what I have been upto all this time. I believe greatness can be achieved if we rise above knowing and start solving!

No! I don't recall, Maybe he was busy doing great things.``
